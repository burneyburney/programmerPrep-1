We all have the same mantra: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat but what's there to steer us in the right direction career wise? Who do we turn to incase of a specific issue? How do we get our foot in the door at that one place? So we made a hub for that. The purpose is to aquire a mentor in the community to usher you in. That's why we created programmerPrep. Day-in and day-out for two weeks the four of us worked the front and the back of this web-application to create a truely one of a kind software as a service. Not just for the four of us, but for the everyone that wanted to join in the "skill pass down" that the tech scene is today.
